# Python GUI Game – "Click the Target!"

I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT (OpenAI, GPT-5.1) to help co-create the code in this repository.

## Overview
This is a simple Python GUI game created for the *CSC-44102 – Foundations of Programming and Software Engineering* module at Keele University.

The game displays a red target that moves to random positions on the screen.  
You have **20 seconds** to click it as many times as you can — each click gives you **1 point**.

## Features
- GUI built using Tkinter
- Randomized target movement
- Countdown timer
- Score system
- Interactive game mechanics

## How to Run
```bash
python3 game.py
